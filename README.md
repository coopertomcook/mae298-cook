In the effort to design a new short-range single-aisle passenger aircraft, my team, MicroRAPTORS, will implement an MDAO framework using Aviary, an open-source framework for aircraft MDAO built on top of OpenMDAO. My role in the team will be to develop the aerodynamic subsystem and its integration into Aviary. There are several subsystems that realistically couple with aerodynamics, which I will be integrating changes with. The primary subsystem I will be working with is the geometry/structure subsystem to ensure a physically feasible wing will be designed within the optimizer. We expect that a purely aerodynamic optimization of the aircraft will lead to impossible or highly impractical designs, so stress analysis, mass analysis, and cost analysis of the wing will need to be taken into account to find a practical design. The RFP for this short-range single-aisle passenger aircraft requests for a dramatic reduction in emissions, which---for the aerodynamic subsystem---means significantly improving aerodynamic efficiency alongside the propulsion system.
