	abstract = {The desire to produce environmentally friendly aircraft that is aerodynamically efﬁcient and capable of conveying large number of passengers over long ranges at reduced direct operating cost led aircraft designers to develop the Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft concept. The BWB aircraft represents a paradigm shift in the design of aircraft. The design provides aerodynamics and environmental beneﬁts and is suitable for the integration of advanced systems and concepts like laminar ﬂow technology, jet ﬂaps and distributed propulsion. However, despite these beneﬁts, the BWB is yet to be developed for commercial air transport due to several challenges. This paper reviews emerging trends in BWB aircraft design highlighting design challenges that have hindered the development of a BWB passenger transport aircraft. The study ﬁnds that in order to harness the advantages and reduce the deﬁciencies of a tightly coupled conﬁguration like the BWB, a multidisciplinary design synthesis optimisation should be conducted with good handling and ride quality as objective functions within acceptable direct operating cost and noise bounds.},

	abstract = {Unconventional configurations and innovative propulsion technologies have been continuously developed for reducing both fuel-burn and global net carbon emissions. This article describes an advanced civil transport aircraft designed from the combination of a Box-Wing configuration with a Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) propulsion system. A conceptual-level Multidisciplinary Design Optimization strategy provided the main aerodynamic and performance characteristics of the aircraft, based on appropriate design requirements, variables and constraints. For direct performance comparison against a conventional aircraft, a single-point objective function based on minimum block fuel was evaluated by means of low-fidelity aircraft models. Subsequently, a back-to-back Computational Fluid Dynamics assessment of non-BLI and BLI versions of the aircraft was performed. Two major analyses comprised the aerodynamic evaluation: (i) quantification of the BLI benefit using the power balance method, (ii) performance evaluation of the propulsor inlet in terms of the total pressure recovery and the distortion index. The conceptual design results showed the box-wing configuration provided major fuel-burn savings compared to its conventional counterpart. On the other hand, the BLI version reduced engine power requirements at cruise in comparison with the non-BLI version, but decreased the total pressure recovery, resulting in more distortion at the aerodynamic interface plane. The main contribution of this study lies on the potential benefits of such an original unconventional configuration, whose technologies increased aerodynamic performance, which reduced fuel consumption and hence carbon emissions.},

Nevertheless, it has not been enough to tackle the rapidly increasing CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emissions (26\% in the 2013-2018 timeframe and expected to continue increasing), which ultimately could grow between 2.4 and 3.6 times by 2050. This scenario has driven governments and the aviation industry to adjust their short term actions and develop a long-term decarbonization agenda, aligned with the Paris Agreement targets. To reach the environmental compromises, the aviation industry is required to bring fleet wide average fuel efficiency improvements of 2.5\% per year, from 2020 to 2050, associated with the use of low carbon energy, such as certified sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and, in the longer term, electric propulsion for specific aviation niches.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="htmlview paragraph"{\textgreater}The continuous efficiency improvement requirement relies on technological strategies, such as the reduction of aircraft weight (through the use of lighter and more resistant materials), engine propulsion (thermodynamic and propulsive) efficiencies, as well as aerodynamic (drag reduction) improvements.

The study was undertaken to highlight the distinct features of the box-wing configuration which make it very attractive for future airliners. The study reveals that the box-wing aircraft possesses a significant aerodynamic advantage over conventional aircraft. The boxwing aircraft configuration is also a less radical departure from the conventional concept. It thus could be developed with existing triedand-tested aircraft design technologies, methodologies, and processes. Hence this article is a commentary that highlights the enormous potential of the box-wing aircraft and the need for further studies in this research domain.},

The major two drawbacks of this design are the handling and the complex design. Due to these issues, this design cannot be used predominantly in the aircraft industry. This paper gives a holistic review of various experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies done on the topic along with the basic analysis and study along various recent developments like geometric alterations such as canard or gurney ﬂaps. The studies done in implementing the advantages of BWB in UAVs and under water bodies are also mentioned in this review. The BWB is a new revolutionary concept that can ﬁnd its way into the modern aircraft design, but it has certain limitations that need to be addressed before using this design commercially or in military aircraft. It is likely that the information acquired in this paper could be useful to the future BWB aircraft design and study along with its various geometric alterations and uses.},

	abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is concerned with solving design problems involving coupled numerical models of complex engineering systems. While various MDO software frameworks exist, none of them take full advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms to solve coupled models efficiently. Furthermore, there is a need to facilitate the computation of the derivatives of these coupled models for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms to enable design with respect to large numbers of variables. In this paper, we present the theory and architecture of OpenMDAO, an open-source MDO framework that uses Newton-type algorithms to solve coupled systems and exploits problem structure through new hierarchical strategies to achieve high computational efficiency. OpenMDAO also provides a framework for computing coupled derivatives efficiently and in a way that exploits problem sparsity. We demonstrate the framework’s efficiency by benchmarking scalable test problems. We also summarize a number of OpenMDAO applications previously reported in the literature, which include trajectory optimization, wing design, and structural topology optimization, demonstrating that the framework is effective in both coupling existing models and developing new multidisciplinary models from the ground up. Given the potential of the OpenMDAO framework, we expect the number of users and developers to continue growing, enabling even more diverse applications in engineering analysis and design.},

	abstract = {This paper presents state-of-the-art technologies of camber morphing mechanisms from the perspectives of design and implementation. Wing morphing technologies are aimed at making the aircraft more energy or aerodynamically efficient during flight by actively adjusting the wing shape, but their mechanism designs and implementation aspects are often overlooked from practical sense in many technical articles. Thus, it is of our interest that we thoroughly investigate morphing mechanisms and their nature of design principles and methodologies from the implementation and test flight aspects, navigate the trends, and evaluate progress for researchers’ methodology selection that possibly turns to design and build stages. This paper categorizes the camber morphing mechanisms from a wide collection of literature on morphing wings and their mechanisms, and the defined classifications are based on mechanism’s design features and synthesis methodology, i.e., by the tools and methods used to solve the design problem. The categories are (1) structure-based, (2) material-based, and (3) hybrid. Most of the structure-based camber morphing mechanisms have distinctive structural features; however, the material-based camber morphing mechanisms make use of material properties and tools to enhance the elastic nature of its structures. Lastly, the hybrid morphing mechanisms are a combination of both the aforementioned categories. In summary, this review provides researchers in the field of morphing mechanisms and wings with choices of materials, actuators, internal and external structure design for wings, and overarching process and design methodologies for implementation with futuristic and practical aspects of flight performance and applications. Moreover, through this critical review of morphing mechanism, selective design criteria for appropriate morphing mechanisms are discussed.},
